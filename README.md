grade-generator.py is an interactive python program that will ask the user to enter assignment name, whether the assignment is a formative or summative assignment, the percentage and the weight. It will calculate the total grade, GPA and pass/fail status then it will export all the entered assignments to 'grade.csv'.
organizer.sh is a shell script that archives any csv file in the current directory, then renames csv files with a timestamp and moves them into the 'archive/' folder then stores the actions/informations.
grades.csv and organizer.log are generated when running the scripts
